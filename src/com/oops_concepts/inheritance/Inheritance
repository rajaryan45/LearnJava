INHERITANCE 

Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all 
the properties and behaviors of a parent object.
It is an important part of OOPs



The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new classes that are built upon existing classes.
When you inherit from an existing class, you can reuse methods and fields of the parent class.
Moreover, you can add new methods and fields in your current class also.

Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship which is also known as a parent-child relationship.


class Subclass-name extends Superclass-name  
{  
   //methods and fields  
}  

The extends keyword indicates that you are making a new class that derives from an existing class.
The meaning of "extends" is to increase the functionality.
